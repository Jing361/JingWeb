<font color="red">Brittany</font> I must be sincere,<br>but I'm held back from constant fear.<br>
There's something I must say,<br>and I hope it's okay.<br>
To me you're a very dear friend,<br>I want our relationship to <i>never</i> end.<br>
Problem is there's more,<br>but not saying it to your face makes my pride sore.<br>
Not sure if I can keep this up,<br>stand by I'll make you a cup.<br>
....of coffee!<br>just kidding, don't you see?<br>
I don't drink,<br>or so I think.<br>
<br>
I must take this opportunity,<br>but your understanding is key.<br>
the timing isn't what I wanted,<br>but it must be said.<br>
This message is hard to send,<br>but <font color="red">Brittany</font> do you want to be my <font color="red">girlfriend?</font><br>
See, now it's there,<br>out in the open air.<br>
I may have asked now,<br>but understand how.<br>
I'll ask you again,<br>not written by pencil or pen.<br>
You deserve better,<br>but my palms are feeling wetter.<br>
It all makes me nervous,<br>but I just enjoy us!<br>
I'm sitting in suspense,<br>but part of me thinks of us in <b>future</b> tense.<br>
Please answer quick,<br>before my stomach gets sick.<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm very moved by your request<br>
Because you don't deserve me, you deserve the best<br>
But I'm incredibly happy you asked, I must confess<br>
So I hope you accept my enthusiastic yes!<br>
I'd say affirmative if I were a robot<br>
And my delight would never stop<br>
So if you can't tell, it doesn't take any force<br>
To give you a 100% of course!!<br>
