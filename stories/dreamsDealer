Glossary
~~~~~~~~

Sandman:
    Dream dealer.
Dreamweaver:
    Type of author from whom synthetic dreams are farmed.  Maybe like a holosuite program.
Replicant:
    Android derogatory term for human.
Automaton:
    Something something androids?
Vor/Nak androhtic society:
    Idea that the advent of androids in modern society changed the very way society worked.
Vor/Nak androhtic machine/computer:
    Idea that a machine/computer's quality or capabilities were significantly changed by the android advent.
Cult of the Cutane(Cutis):
    Cult of androids that want human like skin/appearance.
Cult something something something:
    Cult of android sentience.  Have a ritual into sentience.  Sorta a joke to prove that they're sentient anyway.
Android:
    Newly birthed mechanical/Electronic beings.
    Humanoid in shape.
    Usually built for a specialized purpose.
        -Manufarturing
        -Hazards operations
        -Physical labor
        -Minor domestic tasks
    Sometimes have 'skin', most commonly custom job for the wealthy, or for companies using an android for PR.
    AI and processing technology have reached a point that androids are becoming sentient.
    Some people are becoming aware of this, others disagree, generating a kind of racism.
    Some people are aware but don't care, as they were built for some purpose and 'will be happiest' there.
Human:
    Prejudiced organic beings.  Invented and create androids to help them in business and industry roles, or even domestic ones.

XX Dreams became extinct naturally, and then became forbidden by means of tradition in a tradition driven world.

Androids that have recently gained sentience in a society that doesn't know, or won't admit that the androids are sentient.
The androids can't yet produce their own dreams, existing technology doesn't support it.
Sold dreams are single shot, circuits used are fried. (need better explanation. overheat, like overclock)
Society has only entered nakandrohtic age within the last 100 years, so android technology is still fresh, implications such as sentience still not discovered or understood.
Perhaps humans can use bought dreams as well; special interface.  Perhaps interface has other uses, appears less suspicious.
Dreams market is legal for humans who have a license for the special interface.  Sometimes androids are allowed to purchase dreams legally for an authorized human.

pre or post warp?
    post warp implies a certain exposure level to alien races, and advancement in technology.
    becoming a post warp society mid-story destroys the significance of being in a nakandrohtic society.

Characters
~~~~~~~~~~

Terry Merrit(M)
---------------
Middle-aged hermit who holds decent wealth.  Radical opinions of the android's rights issues.
(?) Old prominent figure in android industry.  Shunned for beliefs of android sentience and rights. Blacklisted in industry.
    Inhereted wealth, enough to build supply chains for Merrit and Fuller he co-founded with Gordon Fuller.
    Ex android designer.  Custom built Datum.
    Merrit and Fuller one of the top in the world, created away from main industry in California for better control over materials and supply chains.
    Built Merrit and Fuller in his home town.

Datum(M)
--------
Potential leader of Sentience movement.
Heavily influenced by Terry's ideas/ideals about sentient androids.
However Datum is more advanced than the average market android, which allows for said sentince. (This means that most androids aren't actually quite capable of sentient thought)
Holds deal between himself and Terry that Datum is free to do as he pleases.
Does favors(like groceries) for Terry in exchange for maintenance and a place to stay.

Andi(F)
-------
Higher end android, higher end systems allow this model to be sentient.
Activated somewhat recently, and very recently gained her sentience.
Named by Natasha.

Derrin(M)
---------
Potential lover for Andi.
Concept and backstory written based on inspiration from this image:
http://bluefley.deviantart.com/art/Impossible-LOV3-ver-3-35710689

she would be andi, and the machine on the left is her attempts at recreating her lost love
she looks into it's eyes, and sees exactly how she remembers his eyes, but none of the love, excitement or joy...the spark his eyes always expressed, and now only a deranged AI that can't find its purpose, it makes her sad

the open skull being a metaphor for how she can see through what it says and thinks, and that it's so shallow, and nothing like how he once was.  She's realizing that life can't be created, and that her life is real, and that she can be just a machine, but that doesn't make her any less human

Alexandre(M)
----------------
Andi's Owner.
Bought Andi for Nat, to keep her company.
Works for Merrit and Fuller.
Works in Advanced Android Calibration (AAC) department.  Kinda like an android psychologist.
Single father of one daughter, Natasha (Nat).

Start out from the perspective of android 'Andi', named by her previous owner's son/daughter.  Switch to her 'dealer's' perspective.
Use 'people' to refer to all sentient beings, so it's unclear he's an android, maybe until after perspective switch.
Andi's reaction to the situation should feel angry and upset; then revealed that he's taken the same stuff he's mad at, and he seems more desperate.

Gordon Fuller(M)
----------------
Co-founded Merrit and Fuller Industries

Merrit and Fuller Industries(N)
----------------------------
Many buildings spread across the town.  Mfg in suburb or rural areas to keep town appearing nice, and pollution levels lower.
Office buildings for execs and android mech and AI design.  Android 'training'/calibration facilities.
Turned town into a very large industrial center.

Short story start (appr. length undecided)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Where is it?  I can't focus!  Where is that man?
That woman on the street clobbered me pretty good; I suppose I should have watched where I was going.
After last night, I can't seem to focus, my head is full of so many new and exciting things!
Listen to me, it sounds like I'm happy about this.
I should never have trusted Datum, he's always seemed to be clean, but when he told me he got something from a Sandman, I should have figured he was up to no good.  I was wrong, it was exactly how it sounded.  Too bad I don't figure this out until well after the fact.  

Finally, Sherker Way, just another block to go.  I'll be there in no time if I can just hurry.
